```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Goal:
Implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate
Inputs: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation
Outputs: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series


Tasks:
1. Draw diagram to represent your model - how it will translate inputs to outputs, with parameters that shape
the relationship between inputs an outputs - on your diagram list what your inputs, parameters and outputs
are with units
2. Implement your diagram as an R function
